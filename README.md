Lithops is a multi-cloud distributed computing framework that allows to run unmodified local python code at massive scale on the major of the publicly-available serverless computing platforms. Lithops delivers the userâ€™s code into the cloud without requiring knowledge of how it is deployed and run. Moreover, its multicloud-agnostic architecture ensures portability across cloud providers, overcoming vendor lock-in.

Lithops provides value for a great variety of uses cases: from big data analytics and embarrassingly parallel jobs, that is, highly-parallel programs with little or no need for communication between processes, up to parallel applications that need to share state among processes. Examples of applications that run with Lithops include Monte Carlo simulations, deep learning and machine learning processes, metabolomics computations, and geospatial analytics.


## Quick Start

1. Install Lithops from the PyPi repository:

    ```bash
    $ pip install lithops
    ```

2. Test Lithops by simply running the next command:
  
   ```bash
    $ lithops test
   ```

## Move to the Cloud
Once you have Lithops working in your local machine, you are ready to scale your python code to the cloud. Lithops provides an extensible backend architecture (compute, storage) that is designed to work with different Cloud providers and on-premise backends. Iin this sense, you can code in python and run it unmodified in IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Aliyun. Moreover, it also provides support for some kubernetes serverless frameworks such as Knative.

3. [Follow these instructions to configure your compute and storage backends](config/)

## High-level API

Lithops is shipped with two different high-level APIs.

    print(result)
```

## Execution Modes

Lithops is shipped with 3 different execution modes. The execution mode allows you to decide where the functions are executed.

<table>
<tr>
<th align="center">

<p> 
<small>
<a href="docs/mode_localhost.md">Localhost Mode</a>
</small>
</p>
</th>
<th align="center">

<a href="docs/mode_serverless.md">Serverless Mode</a>

<p> 
<small>
<a href="docs/mode_standalone.md">Standalone Mode</a>
</small>
</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

This mode allows to run functions in your local machine, by using processes. This is the default mode of execution if no configuration is provided.

</td>
<td>

This mode allows to run functions by using one or multiple function-as-a-service (FaaS) Serverless compute backends. In this mode of execution, each function invocation equals to a parallel task running in the cloud in an isolated environment.

</td>

<td>

This mode allows to run functions by using a cluster of Virtual machines (VM). In the VMs that conform the cluster, functions run using parallel processes.
