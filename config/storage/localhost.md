# Lithops on localhost

Lithops can use a localhost folder to run functions. Note that this storage backend is only valid if you use the [Loclahost compute backend](../compute/localhost.md)


### Configuration

1. Edit your lithops config file and add the following keys:

```yaml
    lithops:
        storage_backend: localhost
```
