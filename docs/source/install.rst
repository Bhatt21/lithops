Install Lithops
===============

You can install Lithops using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

   pip install lithops

This will install the latest version.

If you already have Lithops installed, you can upgrade to the last version using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

   pip install --upgrade lithops

You can also install Lithops from Github and use the master branch. Using the master branch allows you to use the latest features and bug fixes, but keep in mind that the master branch is considered unstable and other problems caused by features that are still under development may arise.

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops
   cd lithops
   python3 setup.py
