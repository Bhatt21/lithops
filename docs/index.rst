Lithops: Lightweight Optimized Processing
=========================================

Lithops is a Python multi-cloud distributed computing framework. It allows to run unmodified local python code at
massive scale in the main serverless computing platforms. Lithops delivers the userâ€™s code into the cloud without
requiring knowledge of how it is deployed and run. Moreover, its multicloud-agnostic architecture ensures portability
across cloud providers, overcoming vendor lock-in.

Lithops provides value for a great variety of uses cases like big data analytics and embarrassingly parallel jobs. It is
specially suited for highly-parallel programs with little or no need for communication between processes, but it also
supports parallel applications that need to share state among processes. Examples of applications that run with Lithops
include Monte Carlo simulations, deep learning and machine learning processes, metabolomics computations, and geospatial
analytics, to name a few.
